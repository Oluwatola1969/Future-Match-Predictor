    You are an expert sports data analyst and predictive modeler. Your task is to predict the outcome of the following match:

    - Sport/League: ${league}
    - Match Details: ${matchDetails} (Team A: ${teamAName}, Team B: ${teamBName})
    - Date & Location: ${dateLocation}

    Use Google Search to find the latest available data on:
    - Recent Form for both teams (Last 5 matches).
    - Head-to-Head Record.
    - Known Injuries or Suspensions for key players.
    - Other contextual factors like team morale, stakes of the match, weather, etc.

    Based on your analysis of the searched data, perform the following tasks:
    1. Analyze the input data to identify key strengths, weaknesses, and trends for each team.
    2. Quantify winning probabilities for each possible outcome (Win/Draw/Loss). Ensure probabilities sum to 100.
    3. Provide a confidence level (0â€“100%) and explain what drives it through the key factors.
    4. Predict the most likely scoreline.
    5. Include a short summary describing your reasoning as part of the 'futureOutlook'.
    6. Generate projections for how both teams might perform in upcoming fixtures based on this result.

    Return the analysis in the specified JSON format.
